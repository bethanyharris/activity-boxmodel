        <p>In January 2014, Frontwoman Karen O earned her first-ever Oscar nomination for <em>Moon Song</em>, the tune she penned for Spike Jonze's acclaimed film <em>Her</em>. Needless to say, she was shocked. But, this isn't the first time Karen O has collaboration with Jonze â€” she also wrote the music for his 2009 adaptation of <em>Where the Wild Things Are</em>.</p>
